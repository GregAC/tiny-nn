Overview
--------

Tiny-NN is a toy neural network accelerator written in system verilog. It's
specifically designed for use with tiny tapeout (https://tinytapeout.com/) and
for use with CNNs (convolutional neural networks) though can do generic
multiply-accumulate operations to implement linear neurons.

The matching tiny tapeout repository can be found at
https://github.com/GregAC/tt10-tiny-nn. sv2v is used to transform the system
verilog into verilog for using with the OpenLANE flow used by tiny tapeout.

Further documentation will follow eventually...
